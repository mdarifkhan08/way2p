<pre class="prettyprint">
1. If we declare constructor as private then we can not create the object of the class inside any other class.<br/><br/>

2. When constructor is private then it is invisible to other class, so that we can not create object of the class<br/><br/>

3.singleton design pattern use concept of private constructor<br/><br/>

4. If we try to extend a class which is having private constructor then compile time error will come.
