Why we need singleton design pattern?
</div>
<div class="panel panel-body">
when we create multiple object of same class then it will take memory inside server and somehow we are wasting memory of server and it cause degrading performance.<br/><br/>

so that we need to have one object and use it multiple times and singleton design pattern help us to do that.

How to create singleton design pattern?

1. It must have private constructor.<br/>
(when we have private constructor then we can not create object of the class from any other class.)<br/><br/>


2. It must have private static variable with data type of variable is same class.<br/><br/>


3.It must have public static factory method having the logic of singleton<br/><br/>
